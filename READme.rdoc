Media Queries are simple filters that can be applied to CSS styles. They are used to change stylings according to the screen sizes of different devices that can view a website. 

In this repository, I created a dummy website using media queries with 2 breakpoints. My stylings change for a iPhone, iPad and a laptop when you manually collapse or enlarge the page.
